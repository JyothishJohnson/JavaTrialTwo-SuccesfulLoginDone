        <item>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel
            and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
            Android\'s user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures
            that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching,
            to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input.
